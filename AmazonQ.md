# Swellnet Cron Troubleshooting

## Issue
The application is failing to run with the error:
```
Error: Cannot find module 'tslib'
Require stack:
- /home/todd/src/swellnet-cron/node_modules/crawlee/index.js
- /home/todd/src/swellnet-cron/lib/index.js
```

## Attempted Solutions
1. Installed tslib as a dependency:
   ```
   npm install tslib --save
   ```

2. Installed tslib as a dev dependency:
   ```
   npm install --save-dev tslib
   ```

3. Installed specific version of tslib:
   ```
   npm install --save-exact tslib@2.8.1
   ```

4. Rebuilt dependencies:
   ```
   npm rebuild
   ```

5. Installed Playwright and its browsers:
   ```
   npm install playwright
   npx playwright install
   ```

6. Rebuilt the project:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

## Next Steps to Try
1. Check Node.js version compatibility - the project might require a specific Node.js version
2. Try installing the project in a fresh directory
3. Check for any peer dependency issues with crawlee and tslib
4. Try using npm link to link the tslib module directly
5. Check if there are any issues with the module resolution in tsconfig.json

## Environment Information
- Node.js version: v23.11.0
- Operating System: Linux
- Project structure: TypeScript project with compiled JavaScript in lib/ directory
